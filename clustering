unsupervised learning
CLUSTERING: Act of organizing similar objects into group
forming a insight about the data

Centeroids (K value)
we usually take distance as the parameter for testing

1.K- is the point to decide the number cluster to form
2.randomly pick the centroid for the each cluster
3.Assignment of each points on the closest centroids
4. Recomputation of centroids as the mean of all data points assigned
5. Moment we end up with no further movement we call it as done


Eculidean Distance:
(by calculating distance between each data point and the centroids)

Notes:
1. it calculates the measure of straight-line distance between two points
2. smaller distance , it is closely to the other points

How do we find the anomalies among our data?
since clustering forms group among the scatter data to find its group
This can be also called data analysis tool.


FLOW chart:

Start the scatering --> initiate no of clusters ===> selection of centroids
---> calculater the distance----> if the distance is min--> move the same cluster
                               --> if the distance is max --> move the another cluster


APPLICATIONS:
1. search engine
2. Insurance Fraud detection
3. Customer segmentation
4. Document classification


Issues:
1. cluster wont be equally distributed
2. it can still have outliers
